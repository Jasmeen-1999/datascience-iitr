Tower of Hanoi 

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle can be solved using recursion. Recursion is a process where a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
Q: Create a condition on x1, x2 and x where print True if x is on the line joining x1 and x2
   

Q: Two lines x1 --> x2 and x3 --> x4, print True, if overlapping or touching otherwise print False
ans: def are_overlapping(x1, x2, x3, x4):
    # Write your logic
    return True or False
Ans:def are_overlapping(x1, x2, x3, x4):
        mx1 = max(x1,x2)
        mn1 = min(x1,x2)
        mx2 = max(x3,x4)
        mn2 = min(x3,x4)
        line1 = list(range(mn1,mx1+1))
        line2 = list(range(mn2,mx2+1))
        new_list = []
        for element in line1:
            if element in line2:
                new_list.append(element)
        print(new_list)
        if new_list == []:
            return False
        else:
            return True
